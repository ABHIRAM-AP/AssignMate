AssignMate is an assignment tracking app that allows students who miss classes to quickly access assignment details.
It also provides an internal calculator to calculate internals of a particular subject.
Students can login directly with their email and password, and view the data.
Once logged in, the students are not required to re-login, and just reopen the app again to view their data!

## Features
 - Students can quickly access their assignment details even if they miss a class.
